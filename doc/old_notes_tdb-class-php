  Text Database system (v.4)
  Author: Pilot and Rebles on PHP Outburst http://myupb.com

  The idea of this version is to offer a quicker and more complex way of dealing with the files
  this version of textdb uses the extension tdb for all its database files.

  4.4.4 update: Fixed MEMO corruption bug:
  Fixed an if-then statement that checks if the index link list contained a cycle.
  Fixed an if-then statement that updates the last written block's index pointer to the block that is represented by EOF.  This statement only executes if there are no more free blocks in the file.  When writing the EOF index, it might right pad the index with an incorrect number of spaces, which may result in a corrupted index, which may result in data corruption.

  4.4.3 update: added SELECT columns functionability when retrieving record(s)
  bug fixed with isTable()
  renamed sortAndBuild() to sort(); left placeholder for sortAndBuild() for backwards compadibility

  4.4.2 update: query results cached
  memo file's first unused block cached
  more bugs fixed
  rewrote memo functions; same process
  tdb::sendError now can use custom error handlers

  TDB_PRINT_ERRORS constant added
  tdb::define_error_handler();
